## General overview
Aggregate data to landings by gear, quarter, market category, stat area assigned to proper ecoregion:
Within year t:
  *Combine* cells to increase sample sizes or *interpolate* individual missing cells? 
Summarize biological samples by year, gear, quarter, market category, stat area. Compare to landings.

## Combine:
* Are there *gear* types with total landings greater than 0 but total sample sizes less than *X*?  
    + if YES: 
        - Combine gear types (explore to see if combined lengths similar) to increase sample size  
        - or Ignore and continue (add to total at the end).  
    + if NO: Count your blessings and continue.  
* Are there *market categories* with total landings greater than 0 but sample sizes less than *X*? (after combining gears)  
	  + if YES: combine market categories with similar length distributions  
	  + if NO : Count your blessings and continue.  
* Are there *quarters* with landings but sample sizes less than *X*?  
	  + if YES: Create semesters?  
	  + if NO: Count your blessings and continue.  
* Are there *strata* with landings but sample sizes less than *X*?  
	  + If YES: define groups of similar strata  
	  + If NO: Count your blessings and continue.  
* Interpolate remaining holes.  
	  + Select length within year/market category from adjacent strata or strata group (after determining if appropriate).  
	  + Select length within year/market category from adjacent quarter or semester (after determining if appropriate).  
	  + Select length within year/market category from adjacent year (after determining if appropriate).  
* If unclassified market category and no other information available:  
	  + Combine market category samples to create an unclassified  
	  + Use appropriate observer length samples to apply to unclassified.  
* If holes remain  
	  + Calculate ratio of sampled to un-sampled landings and expand total length frequency such that expanded sample weight equals total landings weight for year t.

## Interpolate only:
If examination of sample matrix shows only sporadic missing cells with landings but sample sizes less than *X*:  

* Samples by year/gear/quarter/stat area/market category  
	  + Nearest stat area within market category/quarter/gear/year  
	  	  + Keeping year/market category constant:  
	  	  	  + Adjacent quarter/ same stat area  
	  	  	  	  + Adjacent quarter/ any stat area within ecoregion  
	  	  	  	  	  + Adjacent semester/matching stat area  
	  	  	  	  	  	  + Adjacent semester/ any stat area within ecoregion  
                            +  If lengths by gear are similar: Alternative gear/same quarter/stat area	
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  + Alternative gear/same quarter/any stat area
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  + Alternative gear/semester/same stat area
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  + Alternative gear/semester/any stat area
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  + No options- extrapolate to total

*Or combination of both approaches*

## Vocabulary
Definitions to think about.
* Area - could be stock area or EPU
	  + Stat area - smallest unit that the landings are reported to 
	  + Stock area - stock assessment footprint (combined stat areas)
	  + EPU - ecological production unit
* Time - quarter, semester, annual	
	  + Quarter - 3 month
	  + Semester - 6 month
	  + Annual - 12 month
* Length - market categories, cm, 
	  + Market categories - could vary over port, time,
